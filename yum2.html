	<ul>
		<li>1 egg</li>
		<li>1 large lemon, zested and juiced</li>
		<li>1/4 castor sugar</li>
		<li>1 tsp cornstarch</li>
		<li>2 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
		<li>3 egg whites</li>
		<li>5 tblsp castor sugar</li>
		<li>3 egg yolks</li>
		<li>2 tbsp confectioners' sugar'</li>
	</ul>
	<ol>
		<li><em>Preheat</em> oven to 350°F.</li>
		<li>Whisk the egg in a medium saucepan, and mix in one lemon’s zest and juice, 1/4 cup sugar, and cornstarch. Set over medium heat, and cook stirring constantly until mixture thickens. Reduce heat to low, and continue whisking for another minute. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter. Divide between four ramekins. Set aside.</li>
		<li><em>Whip</em> egg whites with an electric mixer in a medium bowl. When they are able to hold a soft peak, sprinkle in 1 tbsp of the sugar, and continue mixing until stiff. Whisk the remaining 4 tbsp of sugar into the egg yolks along with the zest and juice of the remaining lemon. Fold a couple of spoonfuls of the egg whites into the yolks to lighten them up, then fold in the rest of the whites. Spoon into the ramekins over the lemon curd.</li>
		<li><em>Bake</em> ramekins on a cookie sheet for 15–17 minutes, until puffed and golden brown. Let cool for about 5 minutes before serving.</li>
