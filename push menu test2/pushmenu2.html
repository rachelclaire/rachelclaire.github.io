	  <p>For centuries, families have inhabited chalets that dot the valley, caring for herds of small brown and spotted cows that traverse the steep, rocky terrain. Photographer Céline Clanet lived with the valley farmers on and off for two years, documenting their work as part of a project for the Fondation Facim, an organization dedicated to preserving the heritage of the region.
		  “They are like mountain monks,” says Clanet of the farmers, who rise at 4 a.m. to work with the cows, braving snow, rain and falling rocks. The herders must be extremely strong, and many are as young as 18. The work is so demanding that most forgo any kind of social life to carry on the family tradition. Most of the farmers in the Chapieux Valley will work with cows all their lives, following them up the mountainside, milking them, helping them give birth and tending to them when they fall ill.
		  “They are living with their animals all the time,” says Clanet.

		  The herders work with two kinds of cows: the glossy, brown-coated Tarentaise and the Abondance, who have snow-white spots. Both are agile, small and resilient, able to navigate steep hills and withstand harsh weather. Newborn calves begintheir lives on the mountainside. During the winter, both cows and farmers retreat farther down the mountain as avalanche season sweeps in.</p>
