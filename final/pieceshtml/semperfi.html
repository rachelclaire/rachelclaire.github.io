	  <h1>Semper Fi Society Sweatshirt Design</h1>
	  <h2>digital</h2>
	  <p>Marine Officer Paul Kim from Boston University was given my name as a reference while looking for someone to make a design for the Semper Fi Society's new sweatshirt. He specifically wanted a rugged and bold design that included the silhouette of  a marine with his rifle.
